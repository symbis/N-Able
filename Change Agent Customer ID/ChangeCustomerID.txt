The 'ChangeCustomerID.vbs' script must be run via the Probe in N-central.  It accepts a single parameter which is the new customer ID code.

ChangeCustomerID.vbs /new:[CUSTOMER_ID_CODE]


The agent will be stopped and started during execution, so the script will NOT work if you run it using the agent.
