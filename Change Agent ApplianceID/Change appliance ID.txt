The 'ChangeApplianceID.vbs' script must be run via the Probe in N-central.  It accepts a single
parameter which is the new appliance ID code.

ChangeApplianceID.vbs /new:[APPLIANCE_ID_CODE]


The agent will be stopped and started during execution, so the script will NOT work if you run
it using the agent.
